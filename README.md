<center> QuHabiton = Qubit + Habit + iton. </center><br><center>Helping your atomic habits with subatomic math. </center>

QuHabiton is a creative experimental habit tracker that borrows from the principles of quantum physics, topology, and data analysis to offer a unique perspective on habit formation. It encourages users to embrace the complexity and interconnectedness of their habits, fostering a deeper understanding of their personal behavior.

## The Quantum Experience

- **Probabilistic Habits:** Each habit is represented as a quantum state, reflecting the likelihood of success and its connection to other habits.
- **Quantum Machine Learning**: Utilizes Variational Quantum Classifier to analyze and predict habit data and reveal hidden patterns.
- **Behavioral Topography:** Explore the multidimensional landscape of your habits, revealing unexpected relationships and patterns.
- **Quantum Entanglement:** Observe how your habits are entwined, influencing each other's success.
- **Adaptive Learning:** QuHabiton adapts to your progress, offering suggestions for improvement based on your unique habit topology.

We encourage you to share your experiences with QuHabiton, discussing the impact it has on your perception of habits and the insights it uncovers.

## A Note on Creativity

While QuHabiton uses real scientific concepts, it is not intended as a scientifically validated productivity tool. This is a creative experiment.

QuHabiton invites you to question the boundaries of habit tracking and embrace the uncertainty that lies at the heart of human behavior.

## Warning
May cause quantum entanglement with parallel universe versions of yourself. Use responsibly.
